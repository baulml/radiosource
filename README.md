# RRGG - Random Radio Galaxy Generator
![mosaik](/mosaik.png) 

### ***RRGG*** uses the open-source [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) Library (A Community Python Library for Astronomy) to generate a pseudorandom radio source of maximum 1000x1000 pixel. It uses the Gaussian2D modeling function inside of Astropy to simulate a radio source emitted by a variety of differently shaped galaxies. 
### *Disclaimer: This is not a scientific simulation but more a prove of concept of generating random radio noise*


### Requirements
  * Python 3.6 or higher
  * Jupyter Notebook  // *recommended* but not mandatory
  * Numpy
  * Astropy
  * Matplotlib
### Installation

```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install astropy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install numpy
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```
### Important notes
I would recommend creating a folder for the created images
